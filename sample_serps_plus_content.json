Vice Chancellor for Infrastructure and Sustainability Chris Ewing presented the [10 main feedback themes (PDF)](https://www.colorado.edu/sustainability/sites/default/files/attached-files/cap_feedback_incorporation.pdf) that the CAP steering committee extracted from the more than 600 comments that were received during the open comment period.\n**Decision:** The [updated CAP was announced](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/04/25/final-climate-action-plan-released) during the Campus Sustainability Summit. This is a living document that will be revised, added to and improved upon over time.\n## West District Energy Plant update\n**Discussion:** A faculty, staff and student shared governance group that includes members from the Boulder Faculty Assembly, faculty from the College of Engineering and Applied Science and the law school, and a graduate student from the law school submitted a report recommending alternatives to the [planned West District Energy Plant upgrades](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2023/11/08/correction-regent-approved-energy-plant-upgrades-reduce-nitrogen-oxides-help-meet-new-air) following a deeper review of the project.\n**Next steps: **The alternative plan is being assessed to determine next steps related to the project.\n*This is part of a series that will cover CU Boulder Sustainability Executive Council meeting agendas, discussions and decisions. The Sustainability Executive Council brings together decision-makers and leaders from across campus to drive action and accountability to achieve carbon neutrality, goals outlined in the chancellor\u2019s Call to Climate Action and the implementation of the campus Climate Action Plan. *"
