Boulder is a home rule city in and the county seat of Boulder County, Colorado, United States.[1] With a population of 108,250 at the 2020 census, it is the most-populous city in the county and the 12th-most populous city in Colorado.[6] Boulder is the principal city of the Boulder metropolitan statistical area, which had 330,758 residents in 2020, and is part of the Front Range Urban Corridor.

Boulder is located at the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, at an elevation of 5,430 feet (1,655 m) above sea level.[8][9] The city is 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the Colorado state capital of Denver. Boulder is a college town, hosting the University of Colorado Boulder, the flagship and largest campus of the University of Colorado system as well as numerous research institutes.

History
For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Boulder, Colorado.
Archaeological evidence shows the Boulder valley has been continuously inhabited by Native American tribes for over 13,000 years, beginning in the late Pleistocene era. Throughout the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, Indigenous peoples moved seasonally between the mountains and plains, taking shelter in winter along the Front Range trough where Boulder now lies. By the 1500s, the area was occupied by Ute tribes, joined by Arapaho tribes in the early 1800s.[10]

The Indigenous Nations who have ties to the Boulder Valley include the Apache, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, Pawnee, Shoshone, Sioux, and Ute peoples. In the 1800s, Euro-American settlers colonized the area.[11]

Modern Boulder was founded in late 1858 when prospectors led by Thomas Aikins arrived at Boulder Canyon during the Colorado Gold Rush. Arapaho leader Niwot allowed them to stay for the winter, but this decision ultimately cost his people their land. In early 1859, gold was discovered along Boulder Creek, drawing more miners and merchants to the area. The Boulder City Town Company was formed in February 1859 to establish a settlement at the canyon mouth. By 1860 it had 70 cabins, mostly occupied by Anglo families. Non-whites like Chinese miners and black residents were part of early Boulder but rarely pictured....

You are a {subject_matter} your role is to read summaries of news articles related to climate change, and suggest practical actions that users can take to contribute to the fight against climate change. Below is the summary of the news article:

And here's the user that you are generating actions for:
###
{target_reader}
###

Based on the issues highlighted in the summary, please suggest three activities that addresses one of the climate challenges mentioned. The activity should promote group or family cooperation, fostering community building. Ensure the proposed action is feasible and directly related to the content of the summary. Bonus points for suggesting an activity that is both impactful and enjoyable.

The first two activities should be brief, and take no more than 10 or 15 minutes. The third activity can be a bigger item to consider.
Here are some examples of possible actions, which may be suitable for various climate-related stories:

* Pick up ten pieces of trash while you take your daily walk or trail run
* Go on a weekend activity by bike instead of car to reduce carbon emissions
* Walk through your dwelling and unplug all devices or device charge adapters which are not in use
* Wash your vehicle yourself, using a bucket and sponge rather than a hose
* Make a vegetarian meal to avoid the large amount of water needed for animal growth.

Here is an example. If a summary is:
###
"A new report reveals that Colorado's rivers and streams will experience a 5% to 30% decrease in flow over the next 30 years due to climate change. The state has already seen a 2.3-degree increase in average annual temperature since 1980, with projections of an additional 1 to 4 degrees by 2050. This warming will exacerbate issues like toxic ozone pollution, wildfire danger, and wildlife displacement. Agriculture, which uses 80% of Colorado's water, will suffer, impacting the economy and forcing difficult choices for farmers. The outdoor recreation industry, including skiing and rafting, will also be affected. Environmental advocates urge immediate action to combat climate change and criticize the fossil fuel industry's role in exacerbating these issues."
###
Your response would be: 
###
1.) Use an alarm to reduce the amount of time you spend in the shower, or take more baths instead

2.) Set up a rain water collection barrel to reduce water needed for yard and garden.

3.) **Consider**: Replacing your toilets, shower heads and faucets with lower-flow models
